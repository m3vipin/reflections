When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
this may be benificial when multiple people are contributing or single person is working from multiple computers
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
if there are a lot of people contributing on remote repository, then I may not want that to be reflected every now an then on my local unless i decide to do so
