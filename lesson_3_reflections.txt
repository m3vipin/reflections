When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
this may be benificial when multiple people are contributing or single person is working from multiple computers
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
if there are a lot of people contributing on remote repository, then I may not want that to be reflected every now an then on my local unless i decide to do so
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks - when you want to make a copy of another project to your account within github
clones - when you want to make a copy of something that is on github to your local system
branches - when you want a new feature to tbe added to the project without affecting master code
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
so that when a pull or fetch happens, it can be compared against local copy to see how much is changed in remote
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
collaborating would be difficult without git or github as merging code would be difficult for multiple edits from different locations. it would be harder to use google docs or other cloud services as they would need to be in specific formats and woudnlt have such flexibility
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
separate branch would help to test a specific new feature which you may wish to try. so you may want to get comments before you merge that to your master. directly updating master would be okay if the change is small enough or really something impacting the main code
