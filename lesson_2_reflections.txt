What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
initialize is to show that this is my working directory and i need to start version conrol in this.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
working directory can contain other files that you may be temporarily working on. we can add to statging only when we think that it is an incremental change
